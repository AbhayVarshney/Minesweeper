/**
 * MineSweeper
 * Name: Abhay Varshney   Period 4   3/8/16 - 3/14/16
 * Time Spent: 5 hours
 * Reflection: This lab was the most fun lab of the year. There were lots problem solving in this lab. It required
 *             me to really understand what each component was doing in the program. Most of the work was done through
 *             previous labs but what made this lab difficult was tying it all together. I had issues in my view at times
 *             and in my controller and in my model, but looking back, I feel that I had a really fun time making this
 *             project!
