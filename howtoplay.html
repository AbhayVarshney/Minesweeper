		<strong> Overview: </strong> <br/>
		<i> Minesweeper is a game for those who enjoy applying their problem solving and logic skills.
            The game begins with a set of empty tiles. Behind the scenes, there will be mines placed
            at random positions. Your objective is to find the position of all the
            mines without actually denoting the mines. If this happens, you lose. If you are able to
            successfully locate all the mines without denoting any of them, you win! Read more below
            to see how to you can successfully locate the mines.

        <strong> Steps To Success: </strong>
        <ol>
            <li><i>To start a new game, click on 'New Game' in the menu bar. </i></li> <br/>
            <li><i>Click on a random cell. I can guarantee you that you won't land on a mine!</i></li> <br/>
            <li><i>You probably want to click randomly on cells until a set of 5 or 6 cells open up.
                   As you uncover the cells, you will see numbers on cells. These numbers signify
                   how many mines are touching the cell.
            </i></li> <br/>
            <li><i>Knowing this information, place a flag (right click) on a cell you are absolutely
                   certain of being a mine. 'Probably' doesn't work in this situation.</i></li> <br/>
            <li><i>If you are not sure about a certain tile, place a question mark at the position.
                   This serves as a reminder of your suspicions.</i></li> <br/>
            <li><i>This will be timed. So be sure to do this as fast as you can!</i></li>
        </ol>

        &nbsp; &nbsp; <i> If you are not sure about a particular cell, you may place this tile. </i>
        <br/><br/>
        <img src="images/bomb_revealed.gif" alt="Mine"/>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; <i> This is what a mine actually looks like. You want to avoid clicking on this
        cell otherwise the game will end.</i>
